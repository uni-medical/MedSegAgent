    "description": "Airway segmentation is a crucial step for the analysis of pulmonary diseases including asthma, bronchiectasis, and emphysema. The accurate segmentation based on X-Ray computed tomography (CT) enables the quantitative measurements of airway dimensions and wall thickness, which can reveal the abnormality of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Besides, the extraction of patient-specific airway models from CT images is required for navigation in bronchoscopic-assisted surgery.",
